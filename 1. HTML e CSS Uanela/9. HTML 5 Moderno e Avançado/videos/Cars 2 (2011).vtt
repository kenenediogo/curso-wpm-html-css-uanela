171
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.657
How should I know?

172
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.785
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.

173
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.121
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...

174
00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.040
His story gripped the world.

175
00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.459
Oil billionaire Miles AXlerod,

176
00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:18.421
in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,

177
00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:21.841
ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.

178
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.761
Feared dead,
he emerged 36 days later,

179
00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:28.514
running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!

180
00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.600
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,

181
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.645
converted himself from a gas-guzzler
into an electric car

182
00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:36.898
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.

183
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:39.442
Now he claims to have done it
with his allinol.

184
00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:42.070
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do

185
00:13:42.196 --> 00:13:44.447
he's created a racing competition
like no other,

186
00:13:44.573 --> 00:13:46.449
inviting the greatest champions

187
00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:48.576
to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

188
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.745
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

189
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.915
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

190
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:57.210
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

191
00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:01.673
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
" Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.

192
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:03.633
And we all know
what happened to them.

193
00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:06.469
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

194
00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.514
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

195
00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:13.643
nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.

196
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:15.436
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

197
00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:17.355
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

198
00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:20.650
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

199
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:24.195
It is an honor, Signore Dorado,
for you.

200
00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:26.030
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

201
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.657
Of course we invited him,

202
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:30.159
but apparently after his very long
racing season

203
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.245
he is taking time off to rest.

204
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:35.790
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.

205
00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:39.043
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

206
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:44.007
In miles, that is like...
way faster than McQueen.

207
00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.051
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

208
00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.387
- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.

209
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:50.805
- Hello?
- Go ahead.

210
00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:51.931
(LINE GOES DEAD)

211
00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.475
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

212
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.311
MATER: That Italian feller
you got on there

213
00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.938
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.

214
00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:02.525
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

215
00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:05.403
- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,

216
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:08.406
"the bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

217
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.074
MATER: 'Cause he knows
what's important.

218
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.745
Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.

219
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.956
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

220
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.791
This is not news to Francesco.

221
00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.169
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

222
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:22.879
After two laps, I am out cold.

223
00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.173
- (MURMURING)
- MATER: That ain't what I meant.

224
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.509
McQUEEN: What's going on
over there?

225
00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.220
FRANCESCO:
He is afraid of Francesco.

226
00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.598
McQUEEN: That's that
Italian formula car.

227
00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:37.018
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.

228
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.479
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?

229
00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:42.398
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.

230
00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.943
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

231
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.613
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

232
00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:51.491
- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?

233
00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:54.452
MATER: McQueen could drive circles
around you.

234
00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.537
Driving in circles is all he can-a do,
no?

235
00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:57.622
MATER: No.

236
00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:01.375
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

237
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.627
Any time, any track.

238
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:04.629
Mel, can we move on?

239
00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.589
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

240
00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:09.884
a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.

241
00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:13.304
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

242
00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:15.598
Hey! Whoa!

243
00:16:16.099 --> 00:16:17.767
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

244
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:19.811
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

245
00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:23.314
I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.

246
00:16:23.398 --> 00:16:25.942
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

247
00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:28.319
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

248
00:16:28.403 --> 00:16:30.655
Francesco knows how good he is.

249
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:34.075
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

250
00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:37.954
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

251
00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:42.083
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

252
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.543
Not-a so fast, McQueen!

253
00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:45.837
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?

254
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:49.924
Motto? (CONTINUES IN ITALIAN)

255
00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:53.886
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

256
00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:58.099
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

257
00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:01.435
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

You're bringing Mater, right?

267
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.793

Hey, she has-a good taste.

323
00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:39.296
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

324
00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.715
You're right. She's a huge fan!

325

She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

326

Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

with this reaction to Francesco.

- Let's.

Oh. Sorry.

my win tomorrow to her.

So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

335

- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.

into the combustion chamber.

like this before.

540
00:33:01.228 --> 00:33:04.272
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

541

Second, the course itself.

542
00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:08.401
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

543
00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.237
David, how exactly
does this competition work?

544
00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:15.575
All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.

545
00:33:15.701 --> 00:33:17.577
This means that the LMP
and formula cars

546
00:33:17.703 --> 00:33:20.121
should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.

547
00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:22.999
Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.

548
00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:26.086
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,

549
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.588
like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground

550
00:33:28.714 --> 00:33:30.674
but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco

551
00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:33.593
from absolutely running away with it.

552
00:33:33.719 --> 00:33:35.261
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

553
00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:37.180
You forget the most important factor -

554
00:33:37.264 --> 00:33:39.182
that early dirt track section
of the course.

555
00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:42.227

the equalizer in this race.

through there.

558
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:48.733
DARRELL: And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.

559
00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.443
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,

560
00:33:50.569 --> 00:33:53.196
was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.

561
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.992
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

562
00:33:57.118 --> 00:33:59.452
Really, Darrell, you need
to clean your windshield.

pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

to answer questions about its safety.

1031
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.910
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

1032
01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:26.037
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

1033
01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.622
Safe. There it is.

1034

1036
01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:34.003

I just really wish Mater were here.

For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,

1051

to be far away from home is not easy.

the insulting part of that insult.

Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

1510
01:29:39.706 --> 01:29:43.042
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

1511
01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:45.878
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

1512
01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:47.922
Mater, just cut to the chase.

1513
01:29:48.006 --> 01:29:49.966
Okay. It's him.

1514
01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:53.094
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

1515
01:29:53.178 --> 01:29:55.179
I figured it out when I realized

1516
01:29:55.264 --> 01:29:58.683
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts -

1517
01:29:58.809 --> 01:30:02.770
the same bolts that hold together that
old British engine from the photograph.

1518
01:30:03.814 --> 01:30:04.814
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.

1519
01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:07.900
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:

1520
01:30:07.985 --> 01:30:10.653
if there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.

1521
01:30:10.779 --> 01:30:12.655
What is he talking about?

1522
01:30:12.823 --> 01:30:15.366
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

1523
01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:17.118
You just blamed it on me.

1524
01:30:17.202 --> 01:30:19.745
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

1525
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:23.124
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

1526
01:30:24.251 --> 01:30:27.128
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1528
01:30:31.675 --> 01:30:32.842
Stay away!

1529
01:30:32.926 --> 01:30:36.804
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

1530
01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:40.433
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

1531
01:30:40.517 --> 01:30:43.060
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

1532
01:30:43.145 --> 01:30:47.190
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!

1533
01:30:47.274 --> 01:30:50.151
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

1534
01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.737
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.

1535
01:30:53.864 --> 01:30:55.698
Mater, he created allinol.

1536
01:30:55.824 --> 01:30:57.533
But what if he found that huge oil field

1537
01:30:57.618 --> 01:31:00.077
just as the world was trying to find
something else?

1538
01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:04.040
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

1539
01:31:04.124 --> 01:31:06.959
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?

1540
01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:09.170
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.

1541
01:31:09.254 --> 01:31:12.381
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

1542
01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.300
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!

- It's a perfect match.

from the camera, right?

- Explode in a fiery inferno?

- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.

1602

Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline

1603
01:34:22.697 --> 01:34:25.991
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel
